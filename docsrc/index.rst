Welcome to Fil3D's documentation!
=================================

Fil3D is a package for building up masks for 3D filaments in (x, y, v) space from 2D masks in (x, y) space.
If you use FilFinder, you can use the mask and corner objects generated by FilFinder.
If you have your own 2d filament finding algorithm, you only need to input the 2d NumPy bit mask array & the corners to
identify the location of the mask on a given velocity channel.

The algorithm works by matching mask nodes on a given velocity channel with mask nodes on neighboring velocity
channels with a % overlap. Nodes are then connected into a tree of masks forming the outline for the 3D filament.
